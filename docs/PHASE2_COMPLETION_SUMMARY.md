## üé® DESIGN PATTERNS USED

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Amber backgrounds** (50-200) for pricing sections (warmth, affordability)
- **Forest-700 text** on white/amber-50 (AA contrast 4.5:1+)
- **Lime accents** (600) for checkmarks and positive affordances
- **2xl font-bold** for prices (‚Çπ899) - immediate visual priority

### Component Reusability
- **PriceCard:** Used across pricing pages, services, doctors, booking modal
- **Provisional card:** Consistent design between Step 1 and success page
- **Pricing tags:** Same amber badge pattern on doctor cards and profiles

### Accessibility
- **44px+ touch targets** on all CTAs and close buttons
- **Focus rings:** 2px forest-700, visible on all interactive elements
- **ARIA labels:** Descriptive labels on buttons and links
- **Semantic HTML:** `<button>`, `<details>`, `<nav>`, `role="dialog"`

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Collapsed includes/excludes** in compact cards (doctor profiles, modal)
- **"See All Prices"** links instead of overwhelming users upfront
- **Provisional disclaimer** only when items selected

---

## üîß FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (OPTIONAL)

### Phase 3 Ideas
1. **Quote Object & PDF Export**

   - Email quote to user after booking

2. **Multi-City Expansion**
   - Add `/data/catalog/mumbai.json`, `/data/catalog/bangalore.json`
   - City selector on pricing pages
   - Dynamic pricing based on user's city filter

3. **Payment Integration**
   - Accept advance bookings with partial payment
   - Show "Pay ‚Çπ100 to confirm" for high-demand slots
   - Refund policy automation

4. **Service Bundles**
   - "Acne Treatment Bundle: Plan + Follow-up" discounts
   - Cross-sell related services in modal

5. **Doctor-Specific Pricing**
   - Premium doctors with +10-20% fees
   - Shown as "Dr. Sharma (Premium): ‚Çπ989" vs catalog ‚Çπ899

6. **Telehealth Add-ons**
   - Lab test ordering during booking
   - Imaging referrals with fixed catalog prices
   - Medication delivery integration

## üìû SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE

### If Issues Arise
1. **Catalog items not showing:** Verify `getCatalog('pune')` returns data
2. **URL params not working:** Check `useSearchParams()` in booking page
3. **Modal not opening:** Verify `showServiceModal` state and click handlers
4. **Lead storage missing items:** Check API route receives `items` array
5. **Pricing tags not appearing:** Verify specialty mapping in doctors page

### Code Owners
- **Booking flow:** `apps/web/src/app/book/page.tsx`
- **Catalog logic:** `apps/web/src/lib/catalog.ts`
- **Pricing components:** `apps/web/src/components/features/PriceCard.tsx`
- **Doctor pricing:** `apps/web/src/app/doctors/` (page.tsx, [slug]/page.tsx)

---

## üéâ CONCLUSION

Phase 2 successfully transformed Glowheal from variable pricing to a **transparent, fixed-price catalog model**. Users now experience:

- **Clarity:** No more "From ‚Çπ" ranges - exact prices upfront
- **Control:** Select services before booking, see provisional total
- **Confidence:** Payment only after free consultation and consent
- **Consistency:** Same Glowheal prices across all partner doctors

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy to production
2. Monitor lead submissions and analytics
3. Collect user feedback on service selection UX
4. Consider Phase 3 enhancements (quote PDF, multi-city, bundles)

**Well done!** üöÄ
