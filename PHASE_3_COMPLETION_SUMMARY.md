**Completion Date:** [Auto-generated]
**Time Investment:** ~5 hours of implementation

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Quote PDF Generation
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Created `/api/quote/create` POST endpoint (373 lines)
  - Validates leadId, items[], city, contact
  - Fetches catalog items and calculates subtotal
  - Generates print-ready HTML with comprehensive styling
  - Saves to `/data/quotes/YYYY/MM/QUOTE_*.html`
  - Returns metadata with downloadUrl and printUrl
  
- ✅ Created `/api/quote/download` GET endpoint (50 lines)
  - Serves saved quotes with security (path traversal prevention)
  - Headers: `text/html`, `inline`, `max-age=3600`
  
- ✅ Integrated into booking flow
  - Booking page calls quote API after successful submission (non-fatal)
  - Success page displays download link if quoteUrl populated
  - Analytics event: `quote_create` with leadId and itemsCount

**HTML Quote Features:**
- Glowheal branding header with logo and quote metadata
- Patient information card (name, phone, email, concern)
- Itemized services section with includes/excludes
- Subtotal calculation
- **"Amount Due Now: ₹0 (Free Consultation)"** - prominently displayed
- Disclaimers: Provisional, payment after consent, add-ons separate, valid 30 days
- Print button (hidden in @media print)
- Print-optimized CSS with `@page { size: A4; margin: 1cm; }`

**Business Value:**

### Task 2: Multi-City Catalog Scaffolding
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Created `apps/web/src/data/catalog/mumbai.json` (placeholder)
  - 3 specialties: dermatology, mental-health, orthopedics
  - All prices set to `0`
  - Service codes: `TODO_*_MUMBAI`
  - Item names/includes/excludes: `[TODO: ...]`
  - Medical review disclaimer
  
- ✅ Created `apps/web/src/data/catalog/bengaluru.json` (placeholder)
  - Structure matches Mumbai
  - Service codes: `TODO_*_BENGALURU`
  
- ✅ Updated `apps/web/src/lib/catalog.ts` with multi-city support
  - Added `SUPPORTED_CITIES` constant: `['pune', 'mumbai', 'bengaluru']`
  - Added `DEFAULT_CITY` constant: `'pune'`
  - Enhanced `getCatalog()` with:
    - City slug validation and normalization
    - Readiness check: `isCatalogReady()` detects TODO markers and price=0
    - Smart fallback: Mumbai/Bengaluru fall back to Pune if not ready
    - Ultimate fallback: Unsupported cities default to Pune
  - No breaking changes to existing API surface

**Safety Features:**
- ✅ Placeholder catalogs won't activate (price=0 triggers fallback)
- ✅ All catalog consumers (quote, booking, pricing) work across cities
- ✅ Production-safe: Pune remains default until new cities reviewed

**Business Value:**
- Scalability: Infrastructure ready for 2-city expansion
- Safety: Can't accidentally launch incomplete catalogs
- Flexibility: Easy to add more cities (duplicate template, update prices)

---

### Task 3: Enhanced Catalog Validation
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Extended `scripts/validate-catalog.js` with:
  - **Global unique code check:** Prevents collisions across all cities
  - **TODO marker detection:** Warns about placeholder catalogs (`TODO_*` codes, `[TODO]` text)
  - **Includes/excludes validation:** 
    - Errors if includes[] missing or not array
    - Warns if includes[] empty
    - Allows empty excludes[] (some items have no exclusions)
  - **Price validation:** 
    - Must be integer ≥0
    - Warns if price=0 (flags placeholders)
  - **Unit validation:** Must be one of: session, visit, plan, package
  - **Specialty mapping warnings:** Alerts if catalog specialty not in KNOWN_SPECIALTIES

- ✅ Added Husky pre-commit hook
  - Created `.husky/pre-commit` with:
    - `node scripts/validate-catalog.js` - Validates all catalogs before commit
    - `npx lint-staged` - Runs ESLint and Prettier on staged files
  - Prevents commits with invalid catalog data

- ✅ Tested validation script successfully
  - Run: `node scripts/validate-catalog.js`
  - Result: ✅ 3 cities validated (pune, mumbai, bengaluru)
  - Warnings: 12 (correctly flags Mumbai and Bengaluru placeholders as NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION)
  - Errors: 0 (all catalogs structurally valid)

**Business Value:**
- Data integrity: Can't commit broken catalogs
- Expansion safety: Multi-city placeholders flagged until pricing complete
- Developer productivity: Instant feedback on catalog errors

### Task 4: UI Refinements
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Enhanced `PriceCard` component:
  - **Includes disclosure:** Shows first 3 items, expandable `<details>` for rest
  - **Excludes disclosure:** Collapsed by default with chevron icon
  - Native HTML `<details>/<summary>` (no JavaScript, accessible)
  - Keyboard accessible: Space/Enter toggles, focus rings present
  
- ✅ Fixed `DoctorCard` pricing badge truncation:
  - Changed `inline-flex` → `flex flex-wrap`
  - Added `flex-shrink-0` to icon and info button
  - Added `flex-1 min-w-0` to text span (allows wrapping)
  - Badge now wraps gracefully on narrow cards (280px+)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Launch Readiness):
1. **Manual QA:** Run checklist from `PHASE_3_QA_CHECKLIST.md`
   - [ ] axe DevTools audit (target: 0 critical errors)
   - [ ] Lighthouse audit (target: ≥90 Performance, ≥95 Accessibility)
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation test (entire site)
   - [ ] Screen reader test (NVDA or VoiceOver)
   - [ ] Mobile responsiveness (iPhone SE, Android common sizes)

2. **Test Quote Generation End-to-End:**
   - [ ] Book consultation with 2-3 services selected
   - [ ] Verify quote HTML renders correctly
   - [ ] Test print functionality (landscape + portrait)
   - [ ] Verify download link works from success page

3. **Validate Multi-City Fallback:**
   - [ ] Verify `getCatalog('mumbai')` returns Pune data (placeholder detection)
   - [ ] Verify `getCatalog('unsupported')` returns Pune data (default fallback)
   - [ ] Run validation script: `node scripts/validate-catalog.js`

### Short-Term (Pre-Mumbai/Bengaluru Launch):
1. **Finalize Mumbai Catalog:**
   - [ ] Research and confirm Mumbai pricing for all services
   - [ ] Update `mumbai.json` with real prices
   - [ ] Remove `TODO_` prefixes from service codes
   - [ ] Medical review + legal review of pricing
   - [ ] Run validation: `node scripts/validate-catalog.js`

2. **Finalize Bengaluru Catalog:**
   - [ ] Research and confirm Bengaluru pricing
   - [ ] Update `bengaluru.json` with real prices
   - [ ] Remove `TODO_` prefixes
   - [ ] Medical + legal review
   - [ ] Run validation

3. **Test Multi-City Experience:**
   - [ ] Update city selector (currently hardcoded to Pune)
   - [ ] Verify pricing pages display correct city-specific data
   - [ ] Test quote generation with Mumbai/Bengaluru items
   - [ ] Verify doctor pricing badges update per city

### Long-Term (Ongoing):
- Add real patient reviews → enable AggregateRating schema
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production (Search Console)
- A/B test quote download placement (sidebar vs. inline)
- Expand to more cities (replicate placeholder → finalize → launch workflow)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:
1. **Systematic Approach:** Breaking Phase 3 into 7 discrete tasks kept focus
2. **Safety First:** Placeholder detection and fallback logic prevent accidents
3. **Documentation:** QA checklist will help future QA cycles
4. **Accessibility:** Proactive ARIA audit caught issues before manual testing

### What Could Improve:
1. **E2E Tests:** Automated tests for quote generation would catch regressions
2. **Performance Baseline:** Should have captured Lighthouse scores pre-Phase 3
3. **City Selector:** Needs UI updates to actually enable city switching

### Technical Debt:
- [ ] Add unit tests for `getCatalog()` multi-city logic
- [ ] Add integration tests for `/api/quote/create` endpoint
- [ ] Optimize quote HTML (currently 400+ lines inline)
- [ ] Consider moving quote generation to background job for large orders
