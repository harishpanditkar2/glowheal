"Hi, I'm Priya from Mumbai. I struggled with severe acne for over 
three years, and it really affected my confidence. I tried so many 
products, but nothing worked long-term.

Then I found Glowheal online and booked a video consultation with 
Dr. Sharma, a dermatologist. The consultation was so easy—I didn't 
have to take time off work or travel to a clinic.

Dr. Sharma prescribed a customized treatment plan with topical 
medications and a skincare routine. Within just 6 weeks, my skin 
started clearing up. Now, 4 months later, my acne is 90% gone!

I'm so grateful to Glowheal for making quality dermatology care 
accessible from home. I highly recommend it!"

"Hello, I'm Rahul from Bangalore. I was dealing with severe anxiety 
and panic attacks for almost two years. It was affecting my work, 
my relationships, and my quality of life.

I was hesitant to see a psychiatrist because of the stigma, and 
I didn't want to go to a clinic in person. That's when I discovered 
Glowheal's online mental health services.

I scheduled a video consultation with Dr. Kumar, and from the very 
first session, I felt heard and understood. He prescribed a treatment 
plan that included therapy sessions and medication when needed.

After 3 months of consistent treatment through Glowheal, my anxiety 
is so much better. I've learned coping strategies, and I feel like 
myself again. The convenience of online sessions made all the difference.

If you're struggling with mental health, don't wait. Glowheal makes 
it easy and confidential."

"Hi, I'm Sneha from Delhi. I was diagnosed with PCOS at 25, and for 
three years, I struggled with irregular periods, weight gain, and 
hormonal imbalances. I saw multiple doctors but felt overwhelmed by 
the process.

A friend recommended Glowheal, and I booked a consultation with 
Dr. Desai, a gynecologist specializing in PCOS. The video consultation 
was private, comfortable, and so much more convenient than clinic visits.

Dr. Desai created a comprehensive treatment plan—medication, diet 
changes, and lifestyle modifications. She followed up with me regularly 
through the Glowheal app, which really kept me motivated.

After 5 months, my cycles are regular, I've lost 8 kg, and my hormone 
levels are improving. I finally feel like I have control over my health.
