## ⚠️ Critical Notes

1. **Dependencies Not Installed:** All TypeScript errors in console are expected. Run `npm install` in `apps/web/` directory to resolve.

2. **Docs Folder:** The `/docs` folder contains 27,600+ words of comprehensive documentation. It must NEVER be deployed to production. Add `docs/` to `.vercelignore` before deploying.

3. **Doctor Profiles:** Currently have 4 sample profiles. Need to scale to 500+ for production. Consider:
   - Hiring content writers
   - Using AI to generate base profiles (then manually review)
   - Scraping public doctor directories (with legal review)

4. **Medical Content:** All health-related content needs medical review before launch. Look for `[TODO: medical review]` markers in documentation.

5. **Legal Pages:** Terms, Privacy, Disclaimer, etc. need legal review before launch.

6. **WhatsApp Number:** Currently using placeholder `+918329563445`. Replace with real business WhatsApp number before launch.

7. **Images:** All image paths (hero, doctor photos, service images) are placeholders. Need to source/create actual images.

8. **Payment Gateway:** Booking flow uses mock payment. Integrate real payment gateway (Razorpay, Stripe, etc.) before launch.

9. **Core Web Vitals:** Performance targets (LCP ≤2.5s, INP ≤200ms, CLS ≤0.1) must be validated before launch. Test on real devices with slow 3G.

10. **Schema Validation:** All JSON-LD schemas must be validated with Google Rich Results Test before launch.
